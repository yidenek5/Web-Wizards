### Problem Analysis
**Input:** mass and height.   
**Output:** BMI.  

### Pseudocode  
1. Start.
2. Read mass and height.
3. Calculat BMI: BMI = mass / height × height.
4. Print BMI.
5. If BMI is less than 18.5, print "You are underweight."
6. If BMI is greater than or equal to 18.5 and BMI is less than 25, print "You have a healthy weight."
7. If BMI is greater than or equal to 25, print "You are overweight."
8. If you want to calculate again type 'Y' if not type 'N' .
9. Read response.
10. If response is Y, go to step 2.
11. If response is N, got step 13.
12. If invalid character typed go to step 8.
13. End.
